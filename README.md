# Working-Memory-Project-R
Undergraduate project, testing if color has an effect on working memory. 

This Project was assigned in an upper level psychology course. The assignment required us to design and implement a research experiment.
My topic was to see if Color influenced Working Memory. 
Qualtrics was used to develop the survey, qualtrics then reported the data in an Excel File.
The participants were randomly assigned to one of 3 levels, Blue, Red, or Black. 
They were then given a list of words that were colored either blue, red, or black. 
They were then asked to recall as many words that they could remember. 
The data was collected as well as demographic infomation and the duration of time it took to complete the assignment.

The R file shows the progression of data cleaning/transformation, then to data analysis and data visualization. 


Initially this project was done using SPSS and JASP, however R was later used for further analysis and exploration.
